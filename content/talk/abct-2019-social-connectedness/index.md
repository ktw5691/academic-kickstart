abstract = "The link between suicide-related outcomes, particularly suicidal ideation, and social belongingness has long been discussed, beginning with the writings of Durkheim over a century ago (Durkheim, 1897). Since, more recent theories of suicide have incorporated social belongingness or connectedness as core components in the development of suicidal ideation (Klonsky & May, 2015; Joiner, 2005). While these associations have garnered significant empirical support, the large majority of this research relies on the use of Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ; Van Orden et al., 2010) to measure social connectedness. The INQ has allowed for instrumental contributions to the suicide literature and suicide risk prediction; however, given the inherent limitations of Likert-type items and the broad nature of INQ items (e.g., “I feel like I belong), nuanced information about feelings of belongingness (i.e., cognitive-affective reactions, relationship-specific experiences), and their impact on suicidal ideation, may be missed. The use of open-ended questions may capture this level of detail, allowing for a more accurate prediction of suicidal ideation. To test this hypothesis, we collected data from an online sample of 464 individuals (136 with a history of suicidal ideation). Participants were asked to provide a text-based response to the question, “How connected do you feel with those around you? How would you describe your relationships?” and complete the INQ-Short Form (which focuses on social connectedness). We utilized an extension of a supervised topic model that simultaneously incorporates topics from text-responses and other predictors (i.e., INQ score) to predict suicidal ideation. Ten topics were extracted. Controlling for all other topics and INQ score, one topic demonstrated a positive coefficient and credible intervals not including zero (3.42 [SD = 0.49]). Representative (stemmed) words for this topic were: “remarri”, “children”, “tend”, “father”, “dad”, “walk”, “relationship”, “divorce” and “afraid”. Controlling for the extracted latent topics, the INQ demonstrated a negative coefficient and credible intervals not including zero (-0.11 [SD=.001]). Results highlight the potential advantages of utilizing text-based responses in the prediction of suicidal ideation above and beyond traditional Likert-type scales. More specifically, findings demonstrate that the discussion of terminated relationships or relationships that invoke feelings of fear may be particularly relevant in the experience of suicidal ideation."
